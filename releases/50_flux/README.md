# Flux

Effects Processor, Synthesizer and Utility Card for the Music Thing Workshop Computer

It started as a port of PiPicoFX (https://github.com/StoneRose35/cortexguitarfx/tree/rp2040_v1). I modified it to stereo and added more effects (Shimmer Reverb, Lossy Audio, Resonator, etc.). Then I realized there was another core on the Pico, so I added a synthesizer, and then another one and another one, and a sampler. I also ported a part of AMY (https://github.com/shorepine/amy/tree/main) (piano and FM synth). Now I only had to figure out what to do with the CV and pulse outs—they got MIDI to CV, two sequencers, and a port of Mutable Instruments Grids.

This is a bit of a packed card, and that doesnt make the UI very straight forward, so I included optional voice annoucements. The card can also be locked, so the effects and synths cant be changed (useful if you want to have a simplified version of the card). Thism together with a lot of other settigns, Sample Management, Midi mapping (yes Flux is 4 voice polyphonic over midi) and the output config can be done on the web UI:

## Basic Operation

The physical switch controls what the knobs do:

| Switch Position | Mode | Main Knob | Knob X | Knob Y |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UP** | **Synth** | Envelope (Decay) | Pitch | Timbre / Color |
| **MIDDLE** | **Effect** | Wet/ Dry | Parameter 1 (Time, Decay, etc) | Parameter 2 (Tone, Feedback etc) |
| **DOWN (Hold)** | **Select Effect/ Synth** | Change Effect | Change Synth | Extra Synth Parameter  |
| **DOUBLE DOWN (Hold)** | **Performance** | Internal Tempo | Parameter 1 (Sequence A Length, Randomness) | Parameter 2  (Sequence B Length, Randomness)|

---

## Synth Engines
Most synths use: **X = Pitch**, **Y = Timbre**, **Main = Envelope**.
Pulse 1 (and optionally 2) trigger the synth. Can also be polyphonically triggered with midi.

0. **External Input**: Passthrough external audio input.
1. **Wavetable**: Morphing Triangle ➔ Saw ➔ Square ➔ Pulse.
2. **Virtual Analog**: Osc stack through a resonant 24dB filter. **Y** = Cutoff.
3. **Strings**: Karplus-Strong physical modeling. **Y** = Stiffness/Bowing.
4. **Piano**: Additive synthesis spectral piano. **Y** = Brightness.
5. **Modal**: Metallic bells and percussion. **Y** = Harmonic structure.
6. **FM Synth**: 6-op DX7 style engine. **Main** = Env Speed, **Y** = Mod Depth.
7. **Noise**: White noise through a LPG. **Y** = Filter.
8. **Sampler One-Shot**: Triggered samples from flash. **Y** = Start Pos.
9. **Sampler Loop**: Looping samples. **Main** = Length/Dir, **X** = Pitch, **Y** = Start.
10. **Sampler Player**: Looping Player. **Main** = Length/Dir, **X** = Pitch, **Y** = Start.
11. **Sampler Drums**: 4-voice kit. Trigger via Pulse 1/2 or Audio L/R. **Y** = Kit select.
12. **Granular**: Shared grain pool. **Main** = Splatter, **X** = Pitch, **Y** = Position.
13. **Drum Synth**: Synthesized drum sounds. **Main** = Kick, **X** = Snare, **Y** = OH/ CH.

## Effects
Most effects map as: **Knob 1 (Main) = Mix/Blend**, **Knob 2 (X) = Param 1**, **Knob 3 (Y) = Param 2**.

| Category | Effects |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Effect** | X Knob controls input/ synth volume |
| **Dynamics** | Compressor, Equalizer |
| **Amps** | Guitar Amp |
| **Modulation** | Tremolo, Sine Chorus, Vibrato Chorus, Bitcrusher |
| **Pitch** | Pitch Shift, Frequency Shift Delay|
| **Delays** | Digital Delay, Tape Delay, Ping Pong, Tape Loop, Echoverb|
| **Reverbs** | Plate Reverb, Spring Reverb, Freeverb, Shimmer Reverb, Cathedral Reverb, Granular Clouds, Basic Reverb, Allpass Reverb, Hadamard Reverb |
| **Experimental** | Micro Looper, Tape Degradation, Lossy Audio, Spectral Freeze, Oil-Can Echo, Resonator, Wind, Chatter |

*   **Random S&H**: Sample and hold random voltages.
*   **LFO Utility**: Low-frequency oscillator with multiple shapes (Sine, Triangle, Saw, Square, Smooth Random).
*   **Step Sequencer A/B**: 16-step CV sequencers with scale quantization.
*   **Generative Seq A/B**: Algorithmic sequencers.
*   **Clock**: Clock division outputs.
*   **Voice Preview**: Preview synth voices.

### Pulse Outputs
*   **MIDI Gate/Trigger**: MIDI note gates and triggers.
*   **Clock Out**: Clock pulses with divisions.
*   **Voice Audio (PWM)**: Pulse-width modulated audio from synth voices.
*   **Seq A/B Gate**: Gates from step sequencers.
*   **Gen Seq A/B Gate**: Gates from generative sequencers.
*   **Grids (Drum Map)**: Rhythm generator for drums based on Mutable Instruments Grids.

## Web UI (Flux Manager)
Connect via USB and visit the **Flux Manager** to:
*   **Configure CV/Pulse I/O**: Map MIDI to CV, set Clock divisions, or use the Step Sequencer.
*   **Manage Samples**: Drag and drop WAV files to create custom kits for the Samplers and Drums.
*   **Save and share settings**: Export settings as patch cards and build custom cards
