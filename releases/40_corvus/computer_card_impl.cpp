// This file provides the ComputerCard implementation to avoid header-only library issues
#include "ComputerCard.h"

// This file intentionally includes ComputerCard.h to ensure the implementation is compiled
// into our project as a separate translation unit, avoiding multiple definition issues
// when ComputerCard.h is included in multiple files.
